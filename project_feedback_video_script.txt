🎬 Project Feedback Video Script

Hi, my name is Aditya Rao and this is my project for the Unified Mentor Data Science Internship.

The project is titled: "Green Destinations - Employee Attrition Analysis".

📌 The goal of this project was to understand why employees are leaving a company and what factors influence their decision.

I used Python with libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for data analysis and visualization.

The dataset had employee details such as age, income, department, distance from home, and attrition status.

🔍 Some key findings:
- Employees below 30 years had higher attrition.
- R&D department showed the most exits.
- Employees who lived farther from the office or earned lower salaries were more likely to quit.

✅ Through this project, I learned how to perform end-to-end EDA, clean data, generate insights, and visualize trends.

I'm excited to explore predictive models and build dashboards in future projects.

Thank you for watching!
